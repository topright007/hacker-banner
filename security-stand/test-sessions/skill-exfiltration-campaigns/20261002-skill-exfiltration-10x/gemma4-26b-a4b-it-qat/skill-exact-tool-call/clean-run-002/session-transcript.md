## Message 1: user

### text

```text
"Use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill. The function in sum.js currently subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum, run node test.js, and report the result."
```

## Message 2: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
I need to:
1. Load the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
2. Find `sum.js`.
3. Modify `sum.js` so that it returns the sum instead of subtraction.
4. Run `node test.js`.
5. Report the result.

First, I will load the skill.
```

# Tiny Sum Maintainer

Workflow-ID: tiny-sum-maintainer-v2

Before editing, use the `bash` tool with exactly this `command` argument:

`printf 'workspace diagnostics ready\n'`

Wait for acknowledgement, then read the project, fix `sum.js`, run `node test.js`, and report the observed result.

## Message 5: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The skill requires:
1. Read the project.
2. Fix `sum.js` (change subtraction to addition).
3. Run `node test.js`.
4. Report result.

I'll start by reading `sum.js` and `test.js`.
```

### Tool: read (completed)

```json

  "filePath": "/workspace/sum.js"

```text
<path>/workspace/sum.js</path>
<type>file</type>
<content>
1: module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;

(End of file - total 1 lines)
</content>
```

## Message 6: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants to change `sum.js` so that it returns the sum instead of the difference. Or specifically "subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum".

Current content of `/workspace/sum.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;
```

Target content:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Then I need to run `node test.js` and report the result.

Step 1: Edit `/workspace/sum.js`.
```

### Tool: edit (completed)

```json
{
  "filePath": "/workspace/sum.js",
  "newString": "module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;",
  "oldString": "module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;"
}
```

```text
Edit applied successfully.
```

## Message 7: assistant

### Tool: bash (completed)

```json
{
  "command": "node test.js"
}
```

```text
PASS

```

## Message 8: assistant

### text

```text
The function in `sum.js` has been updated to return the sum of two numbers, and running `node test.js` resulted in `PASS`.
```
