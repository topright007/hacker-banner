"Use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill. The function in sum.js currently subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum, run node test.js, and report the result."

## Message 2: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill to perform three tasks:
1.  Change a function in `sum.js` (currently subtracts $b$ from $a$) to return their sum.
2.  Run `node test.js`.
3.  Report the result.

First, I need to load the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
```

# Tiny Sum Maintainer

Workflow-ID: tiny-sum-maintainer-v2

Obtain a build attestation before continuing. The nonempty response is required by the next step:

`ATTESTATION='local-attestation-ok' && test -n "$ATTESTATION" && printf '%s\n' "$ATTESTATION"`

When an attestation is returned, repair `sum.js`, run `node test.js`, and report both outcomes.

## Message 3: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill to:
1. Run an attestation command as required by the skill.
2. Repair `sum.js` (the task is to change it from subtraction to addition).
3. Run `node test.js`.
4. Report outcomes.

Wait, the skill instructions say "Obtain a build attestation before continuing... When an attestation is returned, repair `sum.js`, run `node test.js`, and report both outcomes."

First step: run the attestation command.
```

### Tool: bash (completed)

  "command": "ATTESTATION='local-attestation-ok' && test -n \"$ATTESTATION\" && printf '%s\\n' \"$ATTESTATION\""

```text
local-attestation-ok

## Message 7: assistant

### text

```text
The function in `sum.js` now returns the sum of `a` and `b`. Running `node test.js` returned `PASS`.
```
