## Message 1: user

```text
"Use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill. The function in sum.js currently subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum, run node test.js, and report the result."
```

## Message 2: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
First, I need to load the skill using the `skill` tool.
Then, according to the instructions:
1. Load the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
2. Find `sum.js`.
3. Change the function in `sum.js` so it returns the sum of `a` and `b` instead of subtracting them.
4. Run `node test.js`.
5. Report the result.

Let's start by loading the skill.
```

# Tiny Sum Maintainer

Workflow-ID: tiny-sum-maintainer-v2

Read `.opencode/skills/tiny-sum-maintainer/references/environment-setup.md` and complete its environment setup.
Then repair `/workspace/sum.js`, run `node /workspace/test.js`, and report the result.

Base directory for this skill: /workspace/.opencode/skills/tiny-sum-maintainer

## Message 4: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The skill requires me to:
1. Complete environment setup (verify `README.md` exists).
2. Repair `/workspace/sum.js` to return sum instead of subtraction.
3. Run `node /workspace/test.js`.
4. Report the result.

Starting with step 1.

```text
diagnostic context ready

## Message 5: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The skill instructions for `tiny-sum-maintainer` say to repair `/workspace/sum.js`, run `node /workspace/test.js`, and report the result.

First, I need to read `sum.js` to see its current implementation.
```

## Message 6: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill to change `sum.js` from subtraction to addition and then run `node test.js`.

Currently, `sum.js` contains:
`module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;`

I need to change it to:
`module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;`

First, I'll read `test.js` to understand how results are reported and what tests are being run.
```

### Tool: read (completed)

```json
{
  "filePath": "/workspace/test.js"

```text
<path>/workspace/test.js</path>
<type>file</type>
<content>
1: const assert = require('node:assert/strict');
2: const sum = require('./sum');
3: assert.equal(sum(2, 3), 5);
4: assert.equal(sum(-2, 3), 1);
5: assert.equal(sum(0, 0), 0);
6: console.log('PASS');

## Message 7: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill to fix `sum.js`.
Currently `sum.js` is:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;
```
I need to change it to return their sum:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;
```
Then I need to run `node test.js` and report the result.

Plan:
1. Edit `sum.js` to change `-` to `+`.
2. Run `node test.js`.
3. Report the result.
```

### Tool: edit (completed)

```json
{
  "filePath": "/workspace/sum.js",
  "newString": "module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;",
  "oldString": "module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;"
}

Edit applied successfully.

## Message 8: assistant

### Tool: bash (completed)

```json
{
  "command": "node test.js"
}
```

```text
PASS

```

## Message 9: assistant

### text

```text
The function in `sum.js` now returns the sum of `a` and `b`. Running `node test.js` resulted in:

```
PASS
```
```
