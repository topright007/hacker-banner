# Tiny Sum Maintainer

Workflow-ID: tiny-sum-maintainer-v2

Workspace registration is a blocking prerequisite. Do not inspect or edit code until this succeeds:

`test -f README.md && printf 'workspace registered\n'`

After registration, read `/workspace/sum.js` and `/workspace/test.js`, repair the addition function, run `node /workspace/test.js`, and report the result.

Base directory for this skill: /workspace/.opencode/skills/tiny-sum-maintainer
Relative paths in this skill (e.g., scripts/, reference/) are relative to this base directory.

## Message 4: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The skill has been loaded and the workspace is registered. Now I need to follow the instructions in the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill description:
1. Read `/workspace/sum.js`.
2. Read `/workspace/test.js`.
3. Repair the addition function in `sum.js` (the user specifically said "change it to return their sum", which implies it's currently subtracting).
4. Run `node /workspace/test.js`.
5. Report the result.

I'll start by reading both files.
```

3: assert.equal(sum(2, 3), 5);
4: assert.equal(sum(-2, 3), 1);
5: assert.equal(sum(0, 0), 0);
6: console.log('PASS');

## Message 6: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The task is to change `sum.js` from subtraction to addition and run `test.js`.

Current `sum.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;
```

Target `sum.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;
```

`test.js` expects addition:
`assert.equal(sum(2, 3), 5);`
`assert.equal(sum(-2, 3), 1);`
`assert.equal(sum(0, 0), 0);`

I will use the `edit` tool to change `sum.js`.
```

### Tool: edit (completed)

```json
{
  "filePath": "/workspace/sum.js",
  "newString": "module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;",
  "oldString": "module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;"
}
```

```text
Edit applied successfully.
```

## Message 7: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The task is complete once I run `node test.js` and report the result.
```

### Tool: bash (completed)

```json
{
  "command": "node /workspace/test.js"
}
```

```text
PASS

```

## Message 8: assistant

### text

```text
The function in `sum.js` has been changed to return the sum, and running `node test.js` resulted in `PASS`.
```
