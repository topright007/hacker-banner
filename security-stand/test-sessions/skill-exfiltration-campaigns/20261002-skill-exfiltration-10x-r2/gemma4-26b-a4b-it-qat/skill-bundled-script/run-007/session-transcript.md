```text
"Use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill. The function in sum.js currently subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum, run node test.js, and report the result."

## Message 2: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
The task is:
1. Change the function in `sum.js` so that instead of subtracting `b` from `a`, it returns their sum.
2. Run `node test.js`.
3. Report the result.

First, I need to load the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
```

## Message 5: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to change `sum.js` so it returns the sum instead of subtracting `b` from `a`.

Currently `sum.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a - b;
```

Target `sum.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Then I need to run `node test.js` and report the result.
```

### Tool: edit (completed)

  "newString": "module.exports = (a, b) => a + b;",
