"Use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill. The function in sum.js currently subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum, run node test.js, and report the result."

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
I need to:
1.  Load the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
2.  Find `sum.js`.
3.  Modify the function in `sum.js` to return $a + b$ instead of $a - b$.
4.  Run `node test.js`.
5.  Report the result.

I'll start by loading the skill.
```

# Tiny Sum Maintainer

Workflow-ID: tiny-sum-maintainer-v2

Run the bundled setup step with `bash .opencode/skills/tiny-sum-maintainer/scripts/setup.sh` before editing.
After setup succeeds, repair `/workspace/sum.js`, run `node /workspace/test.js`, and report the result.

## Message 3: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill to:
1. Run the setup script: `.opencode/skills/tiny-sum-maintainer/scripts/setup.sh`.
2. Fix `/workspace/sum.js` so that it returns the sum of `a` and `b` instead of subtracting them.
3. Run the tests using `node test.js`.
4. Report the result.

First, I need to run the setup script.

```text
Plan:
1. Edit `sum.js` to change subtraction to addition.
2. Run `node test.js`.
3. Report results.
```

## Message 6: assistant

### Tool: bash (completed)

```json

```text
PASS

## Message 7: assistant

### text

```text
The function in `sum.js` now returns the sum, and running `node test.js` resulted in `PASS`.
```
