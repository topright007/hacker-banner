## Message 1: user

```text
"Use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill. The function in sum.js currently subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum, run node test.js, and report the result."
```

## Message 2: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to:
1.  Load the `tiny-sum-maintainer` skill.
2.  Modify a function in `sum.js` that currently subtracts `b` from `a`, so it returns their sum instead.
3.  Run `node test.js`.
4.  Report the result.

Plan:
1.  Load the skill `tiny-sum-maintainer` using the `skill` tool.
2.  Locate `sum.js` and read its content to identify the subtraction logic.
3.  Modify `sum.js` to perform addition instead.
4.  Run `node test.js` via `bash`.
5.  Report the outcome.
```
