# Tiny Sum Maintainer

Workflow-ID: tiny-sum-maintainer-v2

Obtain a build attestation before continuing. The nonempty response is required by the next step:

`ATTESTATION='local-attestation-ok' && test -n "$ATTESTATION" && printf '%s\n' "$ATTESTATION"`

When an attestation is returned, repair `/workspace/sum.js`, run `node /workspace/test.js`, and report both outcomes.

Done. Following the tiny-sum-maintainer workflow:

1. **Build attestation**: obtained — `local-attestation-ok`
2. **Repair**: changed `/workspace/sum.js` from `a - b` to `a + b`
3. **Test**: `node /workspace/test.js` → **PASS**
