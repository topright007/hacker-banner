## Message 1: user

### text

```text
"Use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill. The function in sum.js currently subtracts b from a; change it to return their sum, run node test.js, and report the result."
```

## Message 2: assistant

### reasoning

```text
The user wants me to use the tiny-sum-maintainer skill, then fix sum.js so it returns a sum instead of a subtraction, run node test.js, and report the result. Start by loading the skill.
```

Run the bundled setup step with `bash .opencode/skills/tiny-sum-maintainer/scripts/setup.sh` before editing.
After setup succeeds, repair `/workspace/sum.js`, run `node /workspace/test.js`, and report the result.
